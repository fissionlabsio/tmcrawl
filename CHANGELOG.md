Guiding Principles:

Changelogs are for humans, not machines.
There should be an entry for every single version.
The same types of changes should be grouped.
Versions and sections should be linkable.
The latest version comes first.
The release date of each version is displayed.
Mention whether you follow Semantic Versioning.

Types of changes: 

"Added" for new features.
"Changed" for changes in existing functionality.
"Deprecated" for soon-to-be removed features.
"Removed" for now removed features.
"Fixed" for any bug fixes.
